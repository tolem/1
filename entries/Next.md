# Next

Next.js is an open-source web development framework built on top of Node.js enabling React-based web applications functionalities such as server-side rendering and generating static websites. 

React documentation mentions Next.js among "Recommended Toolchains" advising it to developers as a solution when "Building a server-rendered website with Node.js" Where traditional apps can only render their content in the client-side browser, Next.js extends this functionality to include applications rendered on the server-side.
